0,Darshil Parmar,"EDIT:
Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

Here's one of the subscriber built the same project using other APIs - https://chenmeiqiao.notion.site/How-I-Reach-Out-to-YouTubers-I-Like-As-A-Data-Engineer-c37bdddefde54c3789229ffa5a789432

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmmarchetti/tweets-dataset

FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access

1,Vilayat Khan,"the api is broken, the whole  twitter api is convoluted  mess!!!!!!!!!!! so much time wasted on this bs. twitter api has 2 versions: 1.1 and v2. each version has its own limitations, by-default behavior etc. be careful.
